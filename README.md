<h4> Bank Database

<h5> The main objective of this assignment was to design and implement a database that contains information about a banking enterprise, providing a general overview of the enterprise, its basic operations, and related data.

<h5> Initial Requirements

<h5> The following major characteristics of the banking enterprise were considered:

<h5>The bank is organized into branches, each situated in a specific city and identified by a unique name. The bank records each customer's name, as well as the customer's street and city of residence. Each customer is associated with a specific banker, who may serve as a personal banker for that customer. The bank maintains essential information about each employee, including the employee's manager.
<h5>The bank offers two types of accounts: savings and current accounts. Both account types can be held by multiple customers, and a customer can have more than one account. All accounts within the bank have balances expressed in the same currency.
<h5>Note: In a real banking enterprise, the bank would also track deposits and withdrawals. However, in this scenario, we do not include these functionalities.
